# Overview

This project involved development of a proof of concept electric Light Commerical vehicle and validation of the powertrain on a fleet of prototype vehicles 

<br>

# Responsibility
- Calibration engineer for Vehicle Control Unit (VCU). I was responsible for calibrating the entire torque path of vehicle software. This involved understing interaction of the different powertrain components in the system with VCU - battery system, motor drive, charger and HMI.

- Calibrated special vehicle motion functions such as creep/crawl, cruise-control and hill-hold.

- Ensured maintainence and tracking of vehicle software for a fleet of 10 prototype vehicles

- Automation of data collection and analysis of vehicle fleet data (collected over CAN) via Python scripts.
