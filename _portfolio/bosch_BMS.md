# Overview

In this project the goal was to design a low cost 12V BMS capable of managing a Li-ion battery stack with up-to 6 cells in series.

<br>

# Responsibility
- Component selection and benchmarking of key components for BMS - AFE, microcontroller, and power MOSFETS

- Review and assist schematic preparation

- Develop firmware in Eclipse based environment to test rudimentary function of BMS. Interfaced micronctroller with BMS SW driver
