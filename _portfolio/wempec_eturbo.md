# Overview
This is an ongoing project for the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Commandâ€™s Army Research Laboratory to explore using bearingless motor technology to create a new generation of electric turbochargers for aerial vehicles.

# Current Responsibility
- Characterization of a bearingless motor in a static bearingless dynamometer test-stand.

- I am responsible for developing the control code to operate the prototype machine. 

- Conduct experiments to prove speed-power capapility of prototype. The goal of the project is to demonstrate a bearingless machine at 160 kRPM!

- Prepare reports, documentation and slides to present to project stakeholders in a monthly review meeting.

# Technical Details

- All of the control algorithm in developed in MATLAB Simulink. The top-level simulation combines both the controller as well as the plant. The plant models the electrical and mechanical elements of a bearingless machines

- The controller follows a cascaded approach with a outer motion controller followed by an inner current regulator. 
- Complex Vector Current Regualation (CVCR) is used for current regulation. Several other current regulation techniques were implented and benchmarked experimentally before zeroing in on CVCR.
- Rotor position sensing at speeds such as 160 kRPM is a challenge. As part of this project, I have developed sensorless algorithm to estimate the rotor position. This work as resulted in [confernce publication](/publications/).
