# About Me

My name is Anirudh Upadhyaya and I hail from the west coast of India, a temple town called Udupi in the state of Karnataka.

Currently, I am an MS student/researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. I am a part of the [Severson Research Group](https://severson.wempec.wisc.edu/), where my focus lies on applying advanced control techniques to operating ultr-high speed bearingless machines for turbocharger applications. I am also part of [WEMPEC](https://wempec.wisc.edu/).

Before moving half-across the globe to purse my masters degree in 2022, I was working for Bosch Limited, Bangalore on various topics across e-mobility towards realizing electrification for the Indian market.

In my limited free time when I am not doing research work, I like to stay active by working out in the gym, playing badminton and running. I also enjoy different forms of music, ranging from Rock to traditional Indian music.
